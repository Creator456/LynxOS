# LynxOS
A Batch kind of OS. Fork and try to make it bootable.

So basically this is supposed to be an open soucred batch os project. People can fork it and try to make it better. Eventually we 
make the best batch OS ever. I know they are not exactly OS's per se but its still fun to have that creativity in mind.

current version 0.0.1 
Available yet: no
Working on: Making this bootable

i will also make some sort of Developer kit for people who need it,
C456.
